# Module_11_Challenge

In this challenge, we firstly looked to see if there were any unusual patterns in the hourly Google Search traffic particularly for the month of May. It was found that there was an increase in Google Searches through May compared to the median of the rest of the year.
We then grouped the dataset by days of the week and visualised it in a heatmap to get a better understanding of what the data was telling us.
The data was also grouped to see if there was a seasonal trend and it was found that there was a higher number of searches towards the end of the year.
The data was then prepared to see if there was any correlation between stock price and Google searches and there was.
The next preparation was to create the lagged search trends and then apply the Prophet model to see what the predictions would be for the Mercado trends for 2020.
